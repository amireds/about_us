                My Liberty Family is a real but virtual family founded as a social network to improve the social well being of all family members irrespective of their race, religion, location, gender and status.
                <br>
                <br>
                As in conventional family structure, everyone has parents, grandparents, siblings, uncles and aunties, so it is with My Liberty Family. You have virtual parents, virtual siblings, virtual uncles and aunties in your family tree in My Liberty Family  structure.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our aim is very simple. We believe in spreading JOY and HAPPINESS by distributing WEALTH of knowledge within the family equally.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our business is to empower intellectually and financially, every family member to create multiple streams of income thereby improving the quality of lives within the family. We truly believe in the word LIBERTY- your right to live as you wish, go where you want to go.
                <br>
                <br>
                With us, failure and poverty are unacceptable. Both have led many to untold frustrations and anger. As a family philosophy, we believe that if anyone within the family is lacking, we will be affected by their sense of lack. Therefore, the prosperity of ALL in the family is our advantage and we all MUST contribute our portions to everyone’s success story.
                <br>
                <br>
                You are welcome to MLF Jacob Tree.

                                    In our opinion, introducing someone to My Liberty Family™ should be the easiest thing to do. If there are people you care about, people that you love and wish well, friends, spouse, children, relatives, colleagues and even members of your church, mosque and social groups that you think having more financial and economic power would improve their lives, then, being members of My Liberty Family™ would be a good opportunity for them.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Again, imagine 50 of your colleagues becoming members of My Liberty Family™ through you. Aside from helping them discover the potential possibility of membership, there’s no telling what you stand to gain as an individual. There are existing Liberty Family members who are willing and waiting for your invitation to attend a seminar you may organize to help explain Membership Dynamics. There is no rocket science about My Liberty Family™ system. It is a Win Win family affair.

                       Too many people think they are poor because they have no money. They are wrong.  Some others think they are rich because they have money. They are wrong too. Poverty is not the absence of money nor riches the presence of money. Poverty is a state of the mind. This is why you can be given so much money and still become broke in the near future.
                       <br><br>
                       Same reason you can be broke now but with the right mindset, you can become rich and wealthy. My Liberty Family is not a get rich quick family. We truly believe everyone can be rich and wealthy if they have the right mindset, the right education. Our question to you is this: what would you do with it, if you have all the help you need to set up your dream business?

                       The Popular Author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad- Robert Kiyosaki defines Financial IQ as a measure of financial intelligence in an individual. The ability to see opportunities even in a bad situation, such as a recession or plummeting housing market.
                       <br><br>
                       He also describes the general life as Rat Race – The term for the financial situation of the masses. It describes a cycle in which a child excels in school, gets into a “good” college and earns a degree. As an adult, they find a secure, well-paying job with benefits and begin to save money. They get married, buy a house, have children, acquire debt and have increased expenses. They work hard for promotions and save for retirement, but as their income increases, their debts and expenses increase as well.
                       <br><br>
                       Ladies and Gentlemen, lets face it; there is something the truly rich know about money that the truly poor don’t know.The truly rich invest and spend from the returns on their investment.
                       <br><br>
                       The truly poor are consumers. They are spenders and don’t think about any form of investment. This is why they keep getting broke until they become permanently broke and in debt.
                       Asset for example is anything that you acquire that puts money into your pocket. Assets are what the rich use to generate wealth over time. They come in many forms, including real estate, businesses that don’t require you to work at them, and stocks and bonds etc.
                       <br><br>
                       Liability on the other hand is any acquisition which takes money out of your pocket. This is why many people consider owning a car as an asset but it is a liability. Owning a car without a form of investment that generates income is a liability.

                         Money is not wealth but it is the beginning of Riches if well managed and used productively.

                         We have had the opportunity of asking a few people we know that have joined My Liberty Family an important question. Almost all of them didn’t seem to have a plan for the money they are expecting. By that we mean, they have no clue as per what business to put the money into. All we hear is I will buy this, I will buy that and I will sow seed.
                         <br><br>
                         Again, remember the story of the prodigal son in the Bible.
                         He had more than enough money to start out in life but he eventually turned out to be a beggar. Money without a plan can lead to future poverty.
                         <br><br>
                         What would YOU do if N5m – N10 million is given to you to invest? You don’t have to wait to see it before you start planning for it because you can get that much sooner or later than you can imagine.
                         <br><br>
                         STOP worrying about HOW. Concern yourself with developing a plan to use the money to improve the quality of your own life. This is what My Liberty Family represents and that is the real wealth.
