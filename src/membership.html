                And lastly, the Family Foundation which issues your Virtual Family Birth Code or Reference Number. From the foundation purse, there are incentives planned for family members to further strengthen their business and jobs creation aspirations. Also, your status in the family system signifies your Rank within the family structure.
                <br><br>
                Finally, you would be asked to select either of two options. Both carry different financial incentives.

                You join the family with the intention NOT to reproduce 3 of your kind. You may, eventually. The system allows you and helps you grow your family tree without much effort on your part aside from supporting certain family members with the specified amount. This option allows you to receive incentive to the value of up to ₦1 million from other family members. This can be between 3 months to 1 year of your existence in the family tree. It could be much earlier or a little longer.

                You join the family with THE INTENTION to reproduce 3 of your kind within 2 weeks of your existence in the family structure. This option carries a lot of financial benefits to you. First, you receive financial INCENTIVE even at your first level of growth in the family structure.
                <br><br>
                Second, you are programmed to receive support up to ₦10 million in value from other family tree members. This can be between 3 months to 1 year of your membership. It could be earlier or a little longer. Also, there are three Family Trees opened to all. This platform is MLF Jacob Tree™. Membership is ₦25,000 We also have:
                <br><br>
                MLF Isaac Tree™. Membership is ₦37,000 
                <br><br>
                and
                <br><br>
                MLF Abraham Tree™. Membership is ₦47,000.
                <br><br>
                These 3 structures are opened to all under the same options 1 and 2 already specified above. You can choose to belong in the three structures if you wish or start with one. The three run independent of the others and you are given separate Family ID. The differences in the Trees are in the financial obligations required which of course imparted on the financial incentives entitled to.
                <br><br>
                If you are a member of MLF Isaac Tree , you would need to support your immediate e-family members with a total of ₦37,000. What this does for you is to put you on the path to receiving up to potentially ₦40 million worth of incentive from the other members within the MLF Isaac Family Tree. MLF Abraham Tree  is inspired by ₦47,000 membership registration for potential ₦50 million in total financial incentive.

                These all may sound bogus but very possible by our design.
